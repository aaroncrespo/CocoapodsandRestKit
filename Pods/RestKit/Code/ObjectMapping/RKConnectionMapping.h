/**
 Instructs RestKit to connect a relationship of the object being mapped to the
 appropriate target object(s).  It does this by using the value of the object's
 fromKeyPath attribute to query instances of the target entity that have the
 same value in their toKeyPath attribute.

 Note that connectRelationship runs *after* an object's attributes have been
 mapped and is dependent upon the results of those mappings.  Also, connectRelationship
 will never create a new object - it simply looks up existing objects.   In effect,
 connectRelationship allows foreign key relationships between managed objects
 to be automatically maintained from the server to the underlying Core Data object graph.

 For example, given a Project object associated with a User, where the 'user' relationship is
 specified by a userID property on the managed object:

 [mapping connectRelationship:@"user" withMapping:userMapping fromKeyPath:@"userId" toKeyPath:@"id"];

 Will hydrate the 'user' association on the managed object with the object
 in the local object graph having the primary key specified in the managed object's
 userID property.

 You can also do the reverse. Given a User object associated with a Project, with a
 'project' relationship:

 [mapping connectRelationship:@"project" fromKeyPath:@"id" toKeyPath:@"userId" withMapping:projectMapping];
 */
//- (void)connectRelationship:(NSString *)relationshipName fromKeyPath:(NSString *)sourceKeyPath toKeyPath:(NSString *)destinationKeyPath withMapping:(RKMapping *)objectOrDynamicMapping DEPRECATED_ATTRIBUTE;

/**
 Conditionally connect a relationship of the object being mapped when the object being mapped has
 keyPath equal to a specified value.

 For example, given a Project object associated with a User, where the 'admin' relationship is
 specified by a adminID property on the managed object:

 [mapping connectRelationship:@"admin" fromKeyPath:@"adminId" toKeyPath:@"id" withMapping:userMapping whenValueOfKeyPath:@"userType" isEqualTo:@"Admin"];

 Will hydrate the 'admin' association on the managed object with the object
 in the local object graph having the primary key specified in the managed object's
 userID property.  Note that this connection will only occur when the Product's 'userType'
 property equals 'Admin'. In cases where no match occurs, the relationship connection is skipped.

/**
 Conditionally connect a relationship of the object being mapped when the object being mapped has
 block evaluate to YES. This variant is useful in cases where you want to execute an arbitrary
 block to determine whether or not to connect a relationship.

 For example, given a Project object associated with a User, where the 'admin' relationship is
 specified by a adminID property on the managed object:

 [mapping connectRelationship:@"admin" fromKeyPath:@"adminId" toKeyPath:@"adminID" withMapping:userMapping usingEvaluationBlock:^(id data) {
 return [User isAuthenticated];
 }];

 Will hydrate the 'admin' association on the managed object with the object
 in the local object graph having the primary key specified in the managed object's
 userID property.  Note that this connection will only occur when the provided block evalutes to YES.
 In cases where no match occurs, the relationship connection is skipped.

/**
 `RKObjectRequestOperation` is an `NSOperation` subclass that implements object mapping on the response body of an `NSHTTPResponse` loaded via an `RKHTTPRequestOperation`.
 
 Object request operations are initialized with a fully configured `NSURLRequest` object and an array of `RKResponseDescriptor` objects. `RKObjectRequestOperation` is internally implemented as an aggregate operation that constructs and starts an `RKHTTPRequestOperation` to perform the network access and retrieve the mappable data. If an error occurs during HTTP transport, the object request operation is failed with the transport error. Once response data is loaded for the request, the object request operation creates and starts an `RKObjectResponseMapperOperation` to perform the object mapping on the response body. If the mapping operation fails, then object request operation is failed and the `error` property is set. If mapping is successful, then the `mappingResult` property is set and the operation is finished successfully.
 
 ## Acceptable Content Types and Status Codes
 
 Instances of `RKObjectRequestOperation` determine the acceptability of status codes and content types differently than is typical for `AFNetworking` derived network opertations. The `RKHTTPRequestOperation` (which is a subclass of the AFNetworking `AFHTTPRequestOperation` class) supports the dynamic assigning of acceptable status codes and content types. This facility is utilized during the configuration of the network operation for an object request operation. The set of acceptable content types is determined by consulting the `RKMIMETypeSerialization` via an invocation of `[RKMIMETypeSerialization registeredMIMETypes]`. The `registeredMIMETypes` method returns an `NSSet` containing either `NSString` or `NSRegularExpression` objects that specify the content types for which `RKSerialization` classes have been registered to handle. The set of acceptable status codes is determined by aggregating the value of the `statusCodes` property from all registered `RKResponseDescriptor` objects.
 
 ## Error Mapping
 
 If the HTTP request returned a response in the Client Error (400-499 range) or Server Error (500-599 range) class and an appropriate `RKResponseDescriptor` is provided to perform mapping on the response, then the object mapping result is considered to contain a server returned error. In this case, an `NSError` object is created in the `RKErrorDomain` with an error code of `RKMappingErrorFromMappingResult` and the object request operation is failed. In the event that an a response is returned in an error class and no `RKResponseDescriptor` has been provided to the operation to handle it, then an `NSError` object in the `AFNetworkingErrorDomain` with an error code of `NSURLErrorBadServerResponse` will be returned by the underlying `RKHTTPRequestOperation` indicating that an unexpected status code was returned. 
 
 ## Caching
 
 Instances of `RKObjectRequestOperation` support all the HTTP caching facilities available via the `NSURLConnection` family of API's. For caching to be enabled, the remote web server that the application is communicating with must emit the appropriate `Cache-Control`, `Expires`, and/or `ETag` headers. When the response headers include the appropriate caching information, the shared `NSURLCache` instance will manage responses and transparently add conditional GET support to cachable requests. HTTP caching is a deep topic explored in depth across the web and detailed in RFC 2616: http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html

 The `RKObjectRequestOperation` class also provides support for utilizing the `NSURLCache` to satisfy requests without hitting the network. This support enables applications to display views presenting data retrieved via a cachable `GET` request without revalidating with the server and incurring any overhead. The optimization is controlled via `avoidsNetworkAccess` property. When enabled, the operation will skip the network transport portion of the object request operation and proceed directly to object mapping the cached response data. When the object request operation is an instance of `RKManagedObjectRequestOperation`, the deserialization and mapping portion of the process can be skipped entirely and the operation will fetch the appropriate object directly from Core Data, falling back to network transport once the cache entry has expired. Please refer to the documentation accompanying `RKManagedObjectRequestOperation` for more details.
 
 ## Core Data
 
 `RKObjectRequestOperation` is not able to perform object mapping that targets Core Data destination entities. Please refer to the `RKManagedObjectRequestOperation` subclass for details regarding performing a Core Data object request operation.

 When `YES`, network access is avoided entirely if a valid, non-expired cache entry is available for the request being loaded.

In high latency environments, this can result in an improved user experience as the operation does not wait for a 304 (Not Modified) response to be returned before proceeding with mapping.
 
 This optimization has even greater impact when the object request operation is an instance of `RKManagedObjectRequestOperation` as object mapping can skipped entirely and the objects loaded directly from Core Data. Please refer to the documentation accompanying `RKManagedObjectRequestOperation`.
